      "#### 1. Lots and Lots of Data (The \"Textbooks\")\n",
      "AI is nothing without data. It's the fuel. An AI learning to identify cats and dogs needs millions of labeled pictures of cats and dogs. An AI that writes articles (like me!) was trained on a massive portion of the text on the internet.\n",

      "\n",
      "The \"learning\" part is the process of adjusting the connections between these neurons over and over until the output is consistently correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. Computing Power (The \"Engine\")\n",

      "    *   We use a special part of the algorithm to measure the error—how far off the guess was from the correct answer (\"100% cat\").\n",
